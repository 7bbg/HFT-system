# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) System 

This project implements a **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system** that fetches **simulated real-time stock price data**, makes **buy, sell, or hold decisions** based on signals generated by algorithms, and executes trades at simulated speed. The system leverages **Flask** for the backend to handle API calls and **Streamlit** for the frontend to visualize trading signals, stock prices, and trading strategies in real-time.

The application:
1. **Fetch real-time stock data** using high-frequency data sources like Yahoo Finance or other APIs.
2. **Generate trading signals** based on strategies (buy, sell, hold).
3. **Visualize stock prices and trading performance** (e.g., number of stocks bought/sold over time) in real-time.
4. **Simulate trading strategies** price prediction and track their performance over time.

## Demo (Ongoing)
